Selam, sunucumuza hoşgeldin %s. Burada sunucu ile alakalı bilgileri, yapman gerekenleri ve nelere dikkat ettiğimizi bulabilirsin.

Birinci önceliğimiz herkesin arkadaşlarıyla beraber eğlenceli bir GTA: San Andreas deneyimi yaşaması. Tabii bu tarz bir atmosferin kurulabilmesi için herkesin uyması gereken bir kaç kural var. Onlarda şöyle;

Oyuncuları doğduğu gibi öldürmek yasak olup doğum bölgelerinin etrafına pusu kurup çıkanları öldürmek de bu kurala dahildir.

Gerek özel mesajlar üzerinden gerekse herkesin gördüğü (T Chat) üzerinden başkalarının IP, serial, özel isim, fotoğraf gibi kişisel verilerini paylaşmayın. Hoş değil.

Oyun içi bulduğunuz hataları kullanmakta serbestsiniz ancak abartırsanız bunları kullanmanızı engelleyecek yaptırımlar yapabiliriz, bu size özel ya da tüm sunucu için geçerli olabilir. Bu hak bizde kalsın bir zahmet (:

İstediğiniz her konu hakkında konuşabilir ve saygı çerçevesinde tartışabilirsiniz. Reklam yapmanız belli seviyelere kadar göz yumulabilir bir durum örnek veriyorum çok ünlü bir MTA: San Andreas sunucusundan bahsedebilirsiniz. (ÖR: C.I.T, Ateş Gaming, Inception RP)

Bu kadar serbestliğin yanında, aklınızı kullanın, sağduyulu olun. "Kurallarda böyle bir şey yok" diyerek taşkınlık yaptığınız durumlarda yetkililer, inisiyatiflerine göre ceza vereceklerdir. Her zaman yetkililerimizin arkasındayız, sizi cezalandıran yetkilileri sadece başka bir yetkili görebilir. Bu yüzden F1 üzerinden "Sizlere nasıl ulaşabilirim" kısmına bakıp bildirimde bulunabilirsiniz.

Kurallara uyduğunuz için şimdiden teşekkür ederim.

***********************************************************************
* How to prevent high latency
***********************************************************************

High latency occurs for two reasons, either the network is overloaded or you're very far away from the server, consider for instance if you're connected to a wireless network with lot's of disturbances (which pretty much all wireless networks has more or less).

To prevent high latency you neet to consider these two things:
  * If possible, use a cable network rather than a wireless one. That should reduce your latency to max 400 no matter where in the world you're located, (lower values applies to Europe and USA since that's our location).
  * Avoid downloading files while playing, especially torrent files and similar which tends to overflow local networks, also make sure noone else on the same network aren't downloading anything in the background.

What happens when the latency is too high?
We block some features for you temporary, in worst case scenario we kick you. These systems are automatic so don't blame online staff for your own high latency.
